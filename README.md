# Titanic-Survival-Exploration
Project Overview
Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Project

In this project, we will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. We will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce us to some of the concepts of machine learning.There are two Python libraries, numpy and pandas, that we'll use a bit here in this project.
